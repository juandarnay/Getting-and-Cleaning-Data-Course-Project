# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
### Author: **Juan Augusto Darnay**
Data Zip File Location: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The run_analysis.R script will allow to the user to use the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset from www.smartlab.ws
The Script: 
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
